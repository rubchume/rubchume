### Hi there my friend ðŸ‘‹

I am RubÃ©n.

I am a backend Java developer (Hybris framework, Spring) with a background in telecommunications engineering and a strong interest and formal education in data science, data engineering and visualization (with Python programming languange mostly).

Here you can find some of the projects I like to work on in my spare time. Feel free to get inspired by them, fork them and contact me if you have any doubts or want to know a little more about the context (most of them are not thoroughly docummented since I do them for mostly for myself).

Have fun.
