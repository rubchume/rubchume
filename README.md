# Hi there my friend ðŸ‘‹

I am RubÃ©n.

I am an Artificial Intelligence Engineer with a strong academic background in data science, telecommunications engineering, statistics, and data engineering.

I actively contribute to the field through my personal blog, where I share insights and informal experiences. With my passion and expertise in Python, machine learning, and cloud technologies, I strive to make a meaningful impact in the industry.

My daily tech stack: Python, Microsoft Azure ML, Terraform, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, FastAPI, Pandas, Plotly.

Here you can find some of the projects I like to work on in my spare time or that I have done as part of some certification. Feel free to get inspired by them, fork them and contact me if you have any doubts or want to know a little more about the context (most of them are not thoroughly docummented since I do them mostly for myself).

Have fun.

## Projects free tour

Let me give you a brief summary of what you can find here, for free ðŸ˜‰

I have divided this into thes types of projects:
- Data Science/Machine Learning
- Data-oriented Software Engineering
- Software Engineering

### Data science projects

#### [Voice Cloning and Classification](https://github.com/rubchume/VoiceCloningFakeAudioDetection)
- Used an open source voice cloning model for *one-shot* cloning of voices using just a sample of one recorded sentence.
- Trained classification model for distinguising between cloned and real voices with a highly unbalanced dataset and achieving high accuracy.
- Performed the massive training and classification on compute clusters with GPU by using Microsoft Azure ML jobs.

#### [Flip page CNN detector (Microsoft Azure MLOps)](https://github.com/rubchume/FlipPageDetectorCNNAzure)
- Designed and trained a CNN neural network for classifying book pages being flipped or not with more than 98% F1 test score
- Trained it with GPU compute instance in Microsoft Azure, and PyTorch Lightning framework
- Deployed the model to Microsoft Azure ML batch and real time endpoints with the help of MLFlow framework

#### [Bank Marketing Campaign XGBoost Modeling](https://github.com/rubchume/BankMarketingCampaignXGBoostModeling)
- Analyzed data (demographic, financial and data related to marketing) from a marketing campaign where a European bank institution was selling a term deposit, performing Exploratory Data Analysis, binary classification modeling and evaluation of metrics.
- Used XGBoost to predict the success of the campaign given the customerâ€™s available data.
- Performed feature engineering, fine tuning of model hyperparameters and adjusted the decision threshold, achieving a recall of more than 70% and a precision of 50% for a very imbalanced dataset (only 7% of customers bought the term deposit).

#### [Job candidates ranking (Word2Vec)](https://github.com/rubchume/JobCandidatesRankingWord2Vec)
- Created an algorithm to rank potential job candidates based on two criteria: search term and similarity to a candidate (based on job title, location and number of connections) that is manually highlighted as an ideal candidate.
- Used word embedding algorithms (Word2Vec and FastText) for computing the job title similarity and a geographic API for handling closeness of location.

#### [Stock Data Analysis and Trading Strategy](https://github.com/rubchume/StockDataAnalysis)
- Performed time series forecasting of stock data with SARIMAX and Simple Exponential Smothing models
- Created a trading strategy that makes use of previous forecasts using the Backtrader framework and Bollinger Bands as technical indicator

### Data-oriented Software Engineering projects

#### [Facebook Friend Network Analyser](https://github.com/rubchume/FacebookFriendNetworkAnalyzer)

![FriendFacebookNetwork](images/friendsnetwork.png)

- Developed a desktop application for **web scraping** and performing **social network analysis** of your personal Facebook friend network revealing insights and interesting facts you might not know yet.
- Combined different technologies like Selenium, NetworkX, Plotly, Electron and Django for creating the complete application.

Read more about it in this [Medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/read-your-network-of-friends-in-facebook-by-scraping-with-python-a012adabb713).

#### [Picture Anonymiser](https://github.com/rubchume/PictureAnonymizer)

![Picture Anonymiser](images/picture%20anonymizer.jpeg)

- Developed web application for uploading and blurring faces in images.
- Combined technologies like Django, Google Cloud Vision, Google Cloud Storage and Heroku to implement and deploy the full stack application.
- It can serve as a working starting point for more complex applications.

#### [Medium web scraper](https://github.com/rubchume/MediumScraper)

![Medium Scraper](images/MediumScraper.svg)

- Built a fast web scraper for massive download of tens of thousands of Medium articles in a few minutes, filtered by search term and additional critieria, so a machine learning company could train NLP models on them.
- Leveraged Python modern packages and capabilities as **Selenium**, **BeautifulSoup**, **multithreading** and **queues**.

#### [Whatsapp Analyser](https://github.com/rubchume/WhatsappAnalyzer)

- Designed and implemented a web app for analyzing how warm or cold relationships are between members a Whatsapp group chat by using Markov processes and linear algebra.
- Results were shown in expressive and easy to interpret visualizations so surprising insights are clear right away.
- Deployed on Heroku.
- Used modern technological stack: Django, Plotly, Dash, Pandas, Numpy.

### Software Engineering projects

#### [Notion API Manager](https://github.com/rubchume/NotionApiManager)

If you are an organization freak like me, you know what [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is. This app has changed forever the way millions of users take notes.

Even if there are strong competitors like Obsidian or LogSeq that out-compete Notion in the task of creating a *second brain*,
Notion still has the edge as the most balanced note-taking app. It might not be the best in anything, but it is excellent in everything,
and that balance is what makes it my preferred option when it comes taking notes, manage projects and organizing knowledge.

One of the great things of Notion is that its API is simple and easy to use. However, for most common operations it could be even simpler.

This project is a small Python wrapper around the existing and excellent Notion API so creating new pages and consuming existing information becomes a matter of writing a few lines.

It is still very simple, so feel free to adapt it to your own needs.

This package published in **PyPI** and documented with **Sphinx**, and the whole process testing and deploying the new versions of the package is done by running a **Gitlab CI Pipeline**.

#### [Terraform AWS Examples](https://github.com/rubchume/TerraformAWSexamples)

> Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure

**Infrastructure-as-code** (IaC) has changed the world of servers for the better by eliminating manual processes, so the speed of infrastructure management is faster and more consistent since it is written in code.

Moreover, if you are a developer, it will allow you to focus on development more, while letting the software create and manage the infrastructure for you.

I find AWS to be easy to use, and it is wonderfully integrated in Terraform.

This repository is a collection of common IaC configurations for data analysis tasks that you can deploy on AWS right away.

There are very useful examples of how to design complex infrastructures using modularity.
They can serve as starting points that you can then customize to your own needs.

*Be careful because AWS is not free*.
